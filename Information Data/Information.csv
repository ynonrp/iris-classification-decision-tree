img/Iris Setosa.jpg,"Iris setosa is similar in form to a miniature Japanese iris, or a dwarf version of Iris sibirica but a shorter-lived version. The shallowly rooted, large, branching rhizomes spread over time to create large clumps. The rhizomes are grey-brown, thick, and are covered with old (maroon-brown) fibrous leaf remains (of last season's leaves).","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa"
img/Iris Versicolor.jpg,"Iris versicolor is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant, growing 10-80 cm high. It tends to form large clumps from thick, creeping rhizomes. The unwinged, erect stems generally have basal leaves that are more than 1 cm wide. Leaves are folded on the midribs so that they form an overlapping flat fan.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor"
img/Iris Virginica.jpg,"Iris virginica is a perennial plant that grows up to 0.6-0.9 m tall. The plant's sword-shaped basal leaves are erect or sometimes arching and measure up to 91 cm long and 2.5 cm across at the base. The leaves have smooth margins and are bluish green to green and glabrous. Unbranched or sparingly branched flowering stalks rise from the basal leaves to a height of up to 0.6-0.9 m.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica"
